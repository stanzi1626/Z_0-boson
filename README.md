# Z_0-boson
Final programming assignment for Computational Physics University of Manchester.

Two .csv files were provided with data of the Energy of a Z_0 boson from a reaction. 
Data had to be filtered and fitted with a graph derived from Theory to determine the mass of the Boson with an associated uncertainty.

Graphs produced demonstrated fitting function and affect of the change of parameters is roughly quadratic against calculated Energy.
